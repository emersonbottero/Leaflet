Leaflet comes with a set of already defined Projections out of the box:

@projection Projection.LonLat

Equirectangular, or Plate Carree projection — the most simple projection,
mostly used by GIS enthusiasts. Directly maps `x` as longitude, and `y` as
latitude. Also suitable for flat worlds, e.g. game maps. Used by the
`EPSG:4326` and `Simple` CRS.
